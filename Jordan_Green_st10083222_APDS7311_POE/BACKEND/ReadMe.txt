Description:
This application utilizes the Dewey Decimal System to generate ten unique call numbers randomly. The numbers are then presented to the user, who can reorder them in ascending order. The application subsequently verifies the correctness of the user's sorting attempt. While developing, I encountered challenges with aligning the progress bar with user input.

User Actions -
The application offers two main actions:
Replace Books: The app generates ten distinct call numbers and displays them. Users can reorder these numbers.
Verify Order: Users can rearrange call numbers and the app validates their ordering against the correct sequence.
Verify Order 1.2: Depending on the answer, a progress bar has been implemented to show the colour green, and red based on the answer.

Error Features:
I encountered challenges in aligning the progress bar with user input, which affected its functionality. I'm actively working to resolve this issue for an improved user experience. Your patience is appreciated as I address this matter.

Thank you for using my application!
